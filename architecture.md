Hello!

Description of plot:

We have 2 nations: England and France. Player choose nation. Then he can create Swordsman, Archer and Artillery with different stats in different nations.
For example, English Archers have more hp and damage than French. At the other hand, French Swordsmen are stronger than English.


Description of Pattern:

I have used the Abstract Factory Pattern, because it is very suitable and flexible. If I want to enlarge amount of nations or units, I will do it very efficient.
Also, I used that instead of Factory method, because I have several countries with several units. So I can't use it here.
